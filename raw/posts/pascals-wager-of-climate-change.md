Pascal's Wager is famous in christian circles. It comes down to this simple table:

|                        | **god exists** | **god does not exist** |
|------------------------|:--------------:|:----------------------:|
| **you believe**        | heaven         | nothing                |
| **you do not believe** | hell           | nothing                |

Essentially it is saying
- If you believe in god, the best possible outcome is heaven. The worst is nothing happens.
- If you _don't_ believe, the best outcome is nothing, and the worst outcome is _hell_.

The christian perspective is the choice is clear -- you _must_ choose to believe since it has the best possible outcomes. At the very worst, at least _nothing_ happens, rather than eternal damnation.

I want to apply this same logic to another area that christians are... less consistent about:

|                     | **climate change exists** | **climate change does not exist** |
|---------------------|:-------------------------:|:----------------------------------:|
| **we do something** | humanity is saved         | nothing changes                    |
| **we do nothing**   | humanity dies             | nothing changes                    |

- If we do something, the best outcome is we save humanity, and the worst is nothing at all changes.
- If we do _nothing_, the best outcome is nothing changes, and the worst is that _all of humanity dies_.

It seems to me that the choice here is clear.
