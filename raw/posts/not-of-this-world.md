Many christians hold to the idea of ["not being of this world."](https://www.openbible.info/topics/not_of_this_world) What this actually _means_ is up for some debate, but the general agreement is that christians should concern themselves more with the "eternal" rather than the "earthly."

Of course, this argument completely breaks down when said christian is wearing a MAGA hat.
