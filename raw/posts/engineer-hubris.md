One part of engineering culture that I am tired of is the overbearing hubris. This is especially evident in places like hacker news comments and almost exclusively in regards to areas outside of their expertise. The mindset seems to be that being good at one thing (mathematical and logical thinking in regards to software development and technology) makes them experts in any area they spend a couple of hours googling.
