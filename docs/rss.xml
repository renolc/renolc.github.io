<item><title>Look Into A Mirror</title><link>https://phillipgibson.me/posts/look-into-a-mirror</link><description><![CDATA[    <blockquote>    <p>How did this happen? Who's to blame? Well, certainly, there are    those who are more responsible than others, and they will be held    accountable. But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the    guilty, you need only look into a mirror. I know why you did it. I    know you were afraid. Who wouldn't be? War, terror, disease. There    were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and    rob you of your common sense. Fear got the best of you, and in your    panic you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam Sutler. He    promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in    return was your silent, obedient consent. <a href="#fn1"    class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"    role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>    </blockquote>    <section id="footnotes" class="footnotes footnotes-end-of-document"    role="doc-endnotes">    <hr />    <ol>    <li id="fn1"><p><a    href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_for_Vendetta_(film)">V for    Vendetta</a><a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"    role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>    </ol>    </section>    ]]></description></item>
<item><title>Pascals Wager Of Climate Change</title><link>https://phillipgibson.me/posts/pascals-wager-of-climate-change</link><description><![CDATA[    <p>Pascal's Wager is famous in christian circles. It comes down to    this simple table:</p>    <table>    <thead>    <tr class="header">    <th></th>    <th style="text-align: center;">god exists</th>    <th style="text-align: center;">god does not exist</th>    </tr>    </thead>    <tbody>    <tr class="odd">    <td><strong>you believe</strong></td>    <td style="text-align: center;">heaven</td>    <td style="text-align: center;">nothing</td>    </tr>    <tr class="even">    <td><strong>you do not believe</strong></td>    <td style="text-align: center;">hell</td>    <td style="text-align: center;">nothing</td>    </tr>    </tbody>    </table>    <p>Essentially it is saying</p>    <ul>    <li>If you believe in god, the best possible outcome is heaven. The    worst is nothing happens.</li>    <li>If you <em>don't</em> believe, the best outcome is nothing, and    the worst outcome is <em>hell</em>.</li>    </ul>    <p>The christian perspective is the choice is clear -- you    <em>must</em> choose to believe since it has the best possible    outcomes. At the very worst, at least <em>nothing</em> happens,    rather than eternal damnation.</p>    <p>I want to apply this same logic to another area that christians    are... less consistent about:</p>    <table>    <thead>    <tr class="header">    <th></th>    <th style="text-align: center;">climate change exists</th>    <th style="text-align: center;">climate change does not exists</th>    </tr>    </thead>    <tbody>    <tr class="odd">    <td><strong>we do something</strong></td>    <td style="text-align: center;">humanity is saved</td>    <td style="text-align: center;">nothing changes</td>    </tr>    <tr class="even">    <td><strong>we do nothing</strong></td>    <td style="text-align: center;">humanity dies</td>    <td style="text-align: center;">nothing changes</td>    </tr>    </tbody>    </table>    <ul>    <li>If we do something, the best outcome is we save humanity, and    the worst is nothing at all changes.</li>    <li>If we do <em>nothing</em>, the best outcome is nothing changes,    and the worst is that <em>all of humanity dies</em>.</li>    </ul>    <p>It seems to me that the choice here is clear.</p>    ]]></description></item>

<item><title>A Theology Of Rest</title><link>https://phillipgibson.me/posts/a-theology-of-rest</link><description><![CDATA[    <blockquote>    <p>We have developed a robust theology of deprivation. But what we    are too often missing is a theology of delight. We are saturated    with a theology of productivity. But we sometimes lack a theology of    rest.</p>    <p>What does it mean to faithfully enjoy God's good creation? What    would it look like if we believed that rest was of equal importance    as vocation? What if our ability to savor all that is beautiful and    cease from our striving was our greatest testimony to a world that    is absolutely starved for goodness, parched for the living waters of    God's gracious "enoughness."</p>    <p>I wrestle with these questions in my book <a    href="https://amandaheldopelt.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=be691888854ba3d2516543fef&amp;id=8fe3a3ae1d&amp;e=dd6f29a250">Holy    Unhappiness</a>. I don't have all the answers, but there is one    thing I know: For as many times as we are told in Scripture to fast,    we are told to feast, to celebrate God's love. While none of the Ten    Commandments mandate that we build a multi-million-dollar ministry    program, we are commanded to rest. With that rest comes the embodied    belief that God has set us free from the slavery of endless    striving. <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"    role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>    </blockquote>    <section id="footnotes" class="footnotes footnotes-end-of-document"    role="doc-endnotes">    <hr />    <ol>    <li id="fn1"><p><a    href="https://us14.campaign-archive.com/?u=be691888854ba3d2516543fef&amp;id=1b293248ce">Amanda    Held Opelt - On Resolutions and a Personal Update</a><a    href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"    role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>    </ol>    </section>    ]]></description></item>

<item><title>Engineer Hubris</title><link>https://phillipgibson.me/posts/engineer-hubris</link><description><![CDATA[    <p>One part of engineering culture that I am tired of is the    overbearing hubris. This is especially evident in places like hacker    news comments and almost exclusively in regards to areas outside of    their expertise. The mindset seems to be that being good at one    thing (mathematical and logical thinking in regards to software    development and technology) makes them experts in any area they    spend a couple of hours googling.</p>    ]]></description></item>

<item><title>Not A Woman</title><link>https://phillipgibson.me/posts/not-a-woman</link><description><![CDATA[    <blockquote>    <p>Saying a trans woman is “not a woman” because of biology is like    saying adoptive parents are “not really someone’s parents” because    they are not blood relations of their children. It is fallacious,    pure and simple. It assumes that the definition of the word    “parents” is handed to us from on high, that there is some fixed    rule in the universe prohibiting us from using it to refer to people    who have a social rather than a biological relationship with their    children.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"    role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>    </blockquote>    <section id="footnotes" class="footnotes footnotes-end-of-document"    role="doc-endnotes">    <hr />    <ol>    <li id="fn1"><p><a    href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2022/06/what-is-a-woman-is-a-feature-length-exploration-of-conservative-ignorance-and-prejudice">https://www.currentaffairs.org/2022/06/what-is-a-woman-is-a-feature-length-exploration-of-conservative-ignorance-and-prejudice</a><a    href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"    role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>    </ol>    </section>    ]]></description></item>

This is odd coming from protestants,    seeing as their whole thing is that they deconstructed catholic    ideas and formed their own branch of christianity.
