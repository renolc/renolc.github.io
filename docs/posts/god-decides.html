    <p>A debate as old as time - Calvinism vs Arminianism. Election vs
    choice. Sovereignty vs free will.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
    id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
    <p>I'm going to completely ignore all that.</p>
    <p>Don't get me wrong, it's an interesting discussion,
    philosophically speaking. Theologically though, I think the
    conversation usually misses the mark.</p>
    <p>Continuing from my [[god-defines-goodness|previous post]], I
    wanted to elaborate on my statement that "God chooses who to
    save."</p>
    <p>When I speak of choice, I am not talking about choosing at the
    <em>individual</em> level, but at the <em>systemic</em> level. Put
    another way, not about <em>who</em> but <em>how</em>. And in the
    choosing of <em>how</em>, the <em>who</em> becomes implied.</p>
    <p>According to orthodoxy, God is the final authority. There is no
    outside influence that is forcing any decision that God makes. Also,
    there is nothing in existence that God hasn't created or decreed.
    So, the means by which anyone becomes "saved" is, technically
    speaking, completely arbitrary.</p>
    <p>I mean that in the strictest, technical sense. As already stated,
    God cannot be held to the whim of anything or anyone else --
    including the system of salvation. It's not via some cosmic law or
    natural force, because those only exist as God designed.</p>
    <p>So if God so chose, Jesus didn't <em>have</em> to exist at all.
    Meaning "accepting Jesus as your personal Lord and Savior" could
    also be thrown out. God could instead have said that <em>none</em>
    of humanity will be saved. Or <em>all</em> of it. <em>None</em> of
    the whole system that Christians spend an inordinate amount of time
    fighting about has <em>any</em> inherent meaning or necessity,
    because God could have just as easily declared <em>something
    else</em>.</p>
    <p>And so, to bring it all back to my initial point, the idea of
    "personal choice" is still a concept that relies on God's whim. If
    God declared that individual choice rather than election is how the
    system works, then that is only true <em>because</em> God chose it.
    So in the end, no matter how you look at it, no matter if you're
    Calvinist or Arminianist, no matter if you prioritize God's
    sovereignty or love, it is <em>God</em> who has the real power to
    choose <em>who</em> is saved, because only God gets to choose
    <em>how</em> salvation works.</p>
    <p>The next question is, so then whose responsibility really is it?
    If "God is love" like Christians and the Bible claim, then what
    choice do we think God made?</p>
