    <h1 id="the-good-news-vs-pascals-wager">The Good News vs Pascal's
    Wager</h1>
    <p>According to the Christian tradition I grew up in, the Good News
    (aka, the Gospel) is that Jesus Christ came to Earth to provide us a
    means of reconciling with God. We were now able to be "saved" from
    our "sins."</p>
    <p><em>Ironically</em>, that "Good News" turns out to be very
    <strong>bad</strong> news for the vast majority of humanity.</p>
    <p>To explain this further, let's look at Pascal's Wager<a
    href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
    role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>:</p>
    <table>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th></th>
    <th><strong>God exists</strong></th>
    <th><strong>God does not exist</strong></th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><strong>You believe</strong></td>
    <td>heaven</td>
    <td>nothing</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><strong>You don't believe</strong></td>
    <td>hell</td>
    <td>nothing</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>In this argument, if you assume God does not exist, the worst
    thing that will happen to you after you die is nothing at all. And
    yet, if you assume God <em>does</em> exist, the worst thing that
    could happen is eternal damnation (hell). Therefore, it is more
    prudent to believe than to not.</p>
    <p>So, there's a lot wrong with this whole thing, but let's ignore
    all of that for now and just assume Pascal was correct. What does
    this line of reasoning imply about the character of God and the
    "Good News"?</p>
    <p>Well, if you believe the fundamentalists, the number of people
    who <em>truly</em> believe is vanishingly small. This means only a
    tiny portion of humanity will enter into heaven, while the vast
    majority will be condemned to hell. That sounds much more like
    <em>bad</em> news to most people. In this case, it would actually be
    more "good" if God didn't exist, right? If the choice is between
    people dying and nothing happening, vs them dying, <em>and then</em>
    having to live for all of eternity in <em>conscious torment</em>,
    then the former is clearly more "good."</p>
    <p>One could argue about individual choice vs God's elect, and what
    it is any of us truly "deserve," but I hope that it is clear
    something <em>redemptive</em> would be more "good" rather than
    something purely punitive.</p>
    <p>Perhaps we should rethink what we mean when we talk about the
    Good News. It seems like if it isn't actually good for the majority
    of humanity, then it isn't good at all.</p>
