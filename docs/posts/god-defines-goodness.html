    <h1 id="god-defines-goodness">God Defines Goodness</h1>
    <p>Kind of a continuation of [[good-news|my previous post]] where I
    stated that it would be "more good" for God to not exist, than for
    the majority of humans to suffer eternal conscious torment. A common
    argument against that idea would be that God, being the creator and
    sustainer of all things, has the authority to define "goodness"
    however God chooses.</p>
    <p>The claim being, since God <em>created</em> reality, whatever God
    deems must be inherently good. That we, as sinners, all
    <em>deserve</em> the eternal punishment, and that God choosing to
    save even just a <em>few</em> of us is much more than we deserve. If
    we as humans disagree, that is a failing of our own limited
    perspective.</p>
    <p>If we assume that God did indeed create all things, and that
    whatever God chooses is what is good, then one of the remaining
    variables we can play with is the number of people God chooses to
    save.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"

    <p>I know of no traditions that suggest God will save <em>no
    one</em>. This makes sense for a variety of reasons. Such as, why
    bother spending time thinking about or worshiping a being who has no
    plans for you (or anyone for that matter) other than pain? And also,
    it just doesn't seem <em>right</em>, right? Can we <em>really</em>
    lump <em>everyone</em> together as equally bad or unredeemable? No,
    that can't be it, God must save at least <em>some</em> of us. And I
    don't think that is a heretical claim, as every group thinks they
    are the ones who are in the clear.</p>
    <p>So we have established a <em>baseline</em> of goodness that God
    <em>must</em> adhere to, otherwise how can God really be good at
    all? It is clearly more "good" to save some rather than none.</p>
    <p>And yet... why stop at just some? Why not most? Would that not be
    <em>even more</em> good? And it is completely within God's power to
    do so. It's not like God redeeming us takes <em>effort</em> or
    anything, seeing as God is all powerful and wholly in control of
    reality at its very core.</p>
    <p>And yet... why stop at most? You see what I'm getting at?</p>
    <p>It could be argued that salvation for all would go against God's
    desire for justice -- that God isn't <em>only</em> wholly loving,
    but also wholly just. But, if you think about it, "justice" is just
    other term that God can freely define at will. And so what is to
    stop God from saving <em>everyone</em> and saying <em>that</em> is
    what is good and just? The correct answer is nothing, as, according
    to orthodoxy, there is no power <em>above</em> God.</p>

    <li id="fn1"><p>Some might take umbrage with my phrasing here --
    that God might not <em>necessarily</em> "choose" who to save, but
    instead we are <em>all</em> provided with adequate resources to make
    the choice <em>for ourselves</em>. This is a fair point, and
    something I will most likely address in a future post.<a
