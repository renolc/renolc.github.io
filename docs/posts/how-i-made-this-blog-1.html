    <h3 id="collection">Collection</h3>
    <p><a href="/posts/how-i-made-this-blog">Part 0 - High Level
    Overview and Inspirations</a><br />
    Part 1 - GitHub Pages (you are here)<br />

    <h3 id="github-pages">GitHub Pages</h3>
    <p>I decided to host my blog on <a
    href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. It's easy, free,
    and has <a
    href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows">Workflows</a>
    so I can automate tasks.</p>
    <h4 id="enabling-github-pages">Enabling GitHub Pages</h4>
    <p>Getting started is super quick. Just pick what branch and folder
    the root of the site's contents should be and click save.</p>
    <p><video controls src="/media/how-to-enable-github-pages.webm"></video></p>
    <p>Unfortunately, the folder options are hardcoded to either
    <code>/ (root)</code> or <code>/docs</code>. I had originally
    planned to go with <code>/public</code>, but alas. I went with
    <code>/docs</code> because I didn't think the raw md files and
    scripts should be included on the hosted page.</p>
    <h4 id="adding-a-custom-domain">Adding a Custom Domain</h4>
    <p>After enabling the Page was done, I went about adding my custom
    domain. Again, this is very easy.</p>
    <p><video controls src="/media/github-pages-custom-domain.webm"></video></p>
    <p>Ok, it wasn't <em>quite</em> that easy.</p>
    <p>You have to add <a
    href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site">various
    records</a> to your domain. My registrar of choice has been <a
    href="https://domains.google/">Google Domains</a> for a while, and
    their interface for adding said records was pretty straight
    forward.</p>
    <h4 id="enabling-ssl">Enabling SSL</h4>
    <p>After about 24 hours for the domain record changes to be picked
    up by GitHub, it was time for my last challenge: enabling SSL. To be
    frank, I wasn't sure I was up to the task, but I persevered.</p>
    <p><video controls src="/media/github-pages-ssl.webm"></video></p>
    <p>Phew. After that ordeal, my page was all setup and ready to go.
    Except for all of the content and whatnot. That part comes
    later.</p>
