    <p>How did this happen? Who's to blame? Well, certainly, there are
    those who are more responsible than others, and they will be held
    accountable. But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the
    guilty, you need only look into a mirror. I know why you did it. I
    know you were afraid. Who wouldn't be? War, terror, disease. There
    were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and
    rob you of your common sense. Fear got the best of you, and in your
    panic you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam Sutler. He
    promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in
    return was your silent, obedient consent. <a href="#fn1"
