    <p>In evangelicalism, it's currently in vogue to critique the
    deconstructionist movement. This is odd coming from protestants,
    seeing as their whole thing is that they deconstructed catholic
    ideas and formed their own branch of christianity. It seems to me
    like deconstructing institutional thinking is the most truly
    protestant thing anyone could do.</p>
