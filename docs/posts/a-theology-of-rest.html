    <blockquote>
    <p>We have developed a robust theology of deprivation. But what we
    are too often missing is a theology of delight. We are saturated
    with a theology of productivity. But we sometimes lack a theology of
    rest.</p>
    <p>What does it mean to faithfully enjoy God's good creation? What
    would it look like if we believed that rest was of equal importance
    as vocation? What if our ability to savor all that is beautiful and
    cease from our striving was our greatest testimony to a world that
    is absolutely starved for goodness, parched for the living waters of
    God's gracious "enoughness."</p>
    <p>I wrestle with these questions in my book <a

    Unhappiness</a>. I don't have all the answers, but there is one
    thing I know: For as many times as we are told in Scripture to fast,
    we are told to feast, to celebrate God's love. While none of the Ten
    Commandments mandate that we build a multi-million-dollar ministry
    program, we are commanded to rest. With that rest comes the embodied
    belief that God has set us free from the slavery of endless
    striving. <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
